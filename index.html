      Hi! My name is Kyle and I am a junior devoloper, I started off my journey in a 1st line support role
      I wasn't satisfied and wanted to see what else I could do, ever since I was young I wanted to code 
      However I was put off by people telling me I needed to be a maths wiz and growing up in a 3rd world country
      internet access was limited.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I moved to the UK and I got my break working at a company called John Smedley in Matlock, whilst working there
      I saw a lot of oppurtunity to try and automate some very outdated tasks so took to learning python, With this knowledge
      I was able to create a form using ms power apps, this then saved the data to a sharepoint table, then the data was exported
      using a powershell wrapper in python. I then further used my new found Python skills to manipulate the data and generate reports
      that were emailed to interested parties on a schedule with cron (it was all run on a linux vm I set up)
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      My other interests outside of programming and IT are gaming and fishing, love getting out in nature on the weekends to do some
      fishing, seen as though we programmers tend to sit at a desk for 8 hours a day
